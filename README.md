Project Title - Maven Market_ Report
# Project Description: 
Connecting and Shaping the datasets -In this phase, I started by importing the datasets into the software, connecting the datasets, creating relationships among the data tables[the tables that contains the actual information and the foreign keys]  and lookup tables[that contains the primary keys] to build models. 
Adding DAX Measures- Using DAX expression functions such as [Logical operators, Date and time functions, Time intelligence formulas], I created some additional columns and measures which the project requires to build dashboards and create reports.
Building the Reports - Here, i used some visuals to display some specific information like showing the Total revenue against the Last Month Revenue to show the trend and also to show the top 30 products brands. 
At the end of this project, I was able to create a visual representation of the data using the visuals,filters and bookmarks.
In conclucion, Microsoft Power Bi will help businesses to derive more insights,spot trends and patterns to make more informed decisions.
